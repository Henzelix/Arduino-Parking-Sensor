# What is it?
Arduino Parking Sensor works just like a parking sensor in the car - it beeps faster and changes the color depending on the distance between an object and ultrasonic sensor.

# How does it work?
Ultrasonic sensor's (HC-SR04) Trigger pin sends a signal which bounces off an object, which next gets received by Echo pin as a time, counted from time of sending to receiving signal.
